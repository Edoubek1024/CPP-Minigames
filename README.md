# C++ Minigames
This repository contains several C++ files with minigames.

## Connect 4
This project is a console-based implementation of a Connect Four game that supports 2-4 players. Players take turns dropping their "chips" into columns on the board, with the goal of being the first to connect four (get it?) chips in a row, column, or diagonal.

This game starts by prompting the user for the amount of players playing. Then, each player is allowed to choose their username and skin. The skin is simply a unique character used to represent their chips on the board. After all players have entered their details, the game begins and each player can choose a column to place a chip or allow a random one to be chosen. Upon finishing the game, a scoreboard is shown and players are presented with a prompt that allows them to replay the game and possibly increase their scores.


## Tic Tac Toe
This project is a console-based implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game for 2 players. Players take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3 by 3 grid, aiming to align three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.

This game starts by prompting the user to choose which piece will move first. Then, the game begins and each player must place their piece in an open slot on the board until one gets 3 in a row or the board is filled and no one wins, which is considered a "cat's game."
